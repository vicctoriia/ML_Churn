## Churn Prediction


In this project I worked on a classification model to identify whether customers would go into churn or not. This kind of prediction has a very big impact in the business world because the company can eventually take actions (such as marketing efforts) to prevent its customer from abandoning the service or product. 

You can find this dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh0799/churn-modelling) and my full analysis [here](https://medium.com/@whzpvictoria/modelo-de-predição-de-churn-2dd9453db099)!
